    <h2>Burger?!</h2>
    <p>The hamburger is arguably the world's most recognizable sandwich, centered around a seasoned patty of ground beef—or other meat alternatives—that is grilled, fried, or broiled. Its core concept, a convenient protein served inside a piece of bread, evolved from various "Hamburg steak" recipes brought to America by German immigrants in the $19^{th}$ century. Today, the burger is a global culinary icon, customizable with everything from lettuce, tomato, and cheese to gourmet toppings, and stands as the foundation of the modern fast-food industry.</p>
