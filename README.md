🎯 My Project: Odin_recipe

What I'm doing: I'm creating the minimum basic structure for a webpage (the "boilerplate"). This means setting up the main parent elements (<html>, <head>, <body>) and filling the body with the most common elements.

What this proves I can do:

    Set up the fundamental HTML structure.

    Add basic content: paragraphs (<p>).

    Include visual elements: images (<img>).

    Create navigation: hyperlinks (<a>).

In short: I've proven I can build the foundation for any web project using core HTML tags.
